// Discord.js version ^13.0 requires us to explicitly define client intents
const { Client, Events, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');

// When the client is ready, run this code (only once).
// The distinction between `client: Client<boolean>` and `readyClient: Client<true>` is important for TypeScript developers.
// It makes some properties non-nullable.
